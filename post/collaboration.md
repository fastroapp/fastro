I propose a collaboration between programmers, business analysts, and designers
to create several free apps. These apps will be continuously maintained and
developed to attract a large user base.

We will place relevant ads on these apps. If a user wants to remove the ads,
they will need to subscribe monthly.

Profits generated will be divided based on the following percentages, according
to workload assumption.

| Role              | Task                                             | Output                                  |                Sharing Profit                 |

| Designer          | Design UI/UX applications.                       | Clickable Figma Prototype               |                     16 %                      |

| Quality Assurance | Test and ensure the application's quality        | Stakeholder satisfaction                |                     16 %                      |
| Core Framework    | Framework maintenance & app dev coordination     | Fastro Framework & Timeline             |                     10 %                      |

| Freelance Sales   | Attract vendors to run ads on the platform       | Ads placement                           | 5% commission from every income they bring in |

Those schemes can be changed to adapt to different situations and conditions.
