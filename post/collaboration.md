I propose a collaboration between programmers, business analysts, and designers
to create several free apps. These apps will be continuously maintained and
developed to attract a large user base.

We will place relevant ads on these apps. If a user wants to remove the ads,
they will need to subscribe monthly.

Profits generated will be divided based on the following percentages, according
to workload assumption.

| Role              | Task                                                               | Output                                  |                Sharing Profit                 |

| Business Analyst  | Define user requirements & business flow                           | Business Requirements Document (BRD)    |                     14 %                      |
| Designer          | Design UI/UX applications.                                         | Clickable Figma Prototype               |                     14 %                      |

| Backend           | Database desain & create APIs                                      | Application Programming Interface (API) |                     14 %                      |
| Quality Assurance | Test and ensure the application's quality                          | Stakeholder satisfaction                |                     14 %                      |

| Core Framework    | Framework maintenance                                              | Framework                               |                      6 %                      |
| Infrastructure    | Maintain the operational of Server & Database                      | CI/CD, Deployment                       |                      5 %                      |

Those schemes can be changed to adapt to different situations and conditions.

## Use case

It is posibble for a contributor to handle multiple task. And each task will be
calculated as sharing profit ratio.

For example: imam's initial contribution was to design the purchase application
(as a designer).

However, to ensure a user-friendly experience, he then needed to gather feedback
from actual users on how the application functioned (acting as a business
analyst).

Once the application was developed by the development team (including
developers, QA testers, DevOps engineers, and a product manager), Imam
successfully attracted brands to place advertisements on the platform.

Therefore, Imam's total contribution would be calculated as 14% + 14% = 28%

He also gets a 5% commission on the deals he secures with brands.
