I propose a collaboration between programmers, business analysts, and designers
to create several free apps. These apps will be continuously maintained and
developed to attract a large user base.

We will place relevant ads on these apps. If a user wants to remove the ads,
they will need to subscribe monthly.

Every profit generated will be divided according to the following percentages.

| Role               | Description                                                   | Sharing Profit |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| Business Analyst   | Define user requirements & business flow                      |      22 %      |
| Designer           | Design UI/UX applications.                                    |      22 %      |
| Backend Developer  | Desain the database, build, test, and deploy the applications |      23 %      |
| Frontend Developer | Create a user interface and integrate it with APIs            |      23 %      |
| Sales              | Attract brands to run ads on the platform                     |      5 %       |

Those schemes can be changed to adapt to different situations and conditions.
