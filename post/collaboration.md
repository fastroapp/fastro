As the employee, you typically receive a fixed income based on a salary. That's
perfectly acceptable.

However, I now propose a collaboration between business analyst, designer,
product manager, programmer, and quality assurance -- to create several free
apps.

These apps will be continuously maintained and developed to attract a large user
base. We will place relevant ads on these apps. If a user wants to remove the
ads, they will need to subscribe on a monthly basis.

Profits generated will be divided based on the following percentages, according
to assumed workload.

| Role              | Task                                                               | Output                                              | Sharing Profit |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| Business Analyst  | Define user requirements & business flow                           | Business Requirements Document (BRD)                |     12.5 %     |
| Designer          | Design UI/UX applications.                                         | Clickable Figma Prototype                           |     12.5 %     |

| Backend           | Database desain & create APIs                                      | Application Programming Interface (API)             |     12.5 %     |
| Quality Assurance | Test and ensure the application's quality                          | Stakeholder satisfaction                            |     12.5 %     |
| Infrastructure    | Maintain the operational of Server & Database                      | CI/CD, Deployment                                   |     12.5 %     |

## Comission from every new income

| Role  | Task                                                                       | Output                     | commission |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | :--------: |
| Sales | Attract vendors and brands to run ads on the platform. Acquire paid users. | Ads placement & paid users |     5%     |

## Use cases

It is posibble for a contributor to handle multiple task. And each task will be
calculated as sharing profit ratio.

#### Business Analyst + Designer + Product Manager

> Imam's initial contribution was to design the purchase application (as a
> designer).
>
> However, to ensure a user-friendly experience, he gathered feedback from
> actual users on how the application functioned (acting as a business analyst).
> He also created user stories, scrum artifacts, set up user and business
> metrics (as a product manager).
>
> Therefore, Imam's total contribution would be calculated as 12.5% + 12.5% +
> 12.5% = 37.5%

#### Frontend + Quality Assurance

> Firman's task is to create the user interface and experience (as a frontend
> developer). But he also makes sure all features are working as expected
> (acting as Quality Assurance).
>
> Once the application was developed by the development team (including
> developers, QA testers, DevOps engineers), Firman successfully attracted
> brands to place advertisements on the platform.
>
> Therefore, Firman's total contribution would be calculated as 12.5% + 12.5% =
> 25%
>
> He also gets a 5% commission on the deals he secures with brands.

#### Founder + Backend + Infrastructure

> Yanu is the Founder of Framework. His tasks include updating and syncing with
> the upstream dependency (as a Core Framework).
>
> In addition, he designs the database, creates APIs for the application (acting
> as backend), and sets up the CI/CD for application deployment (acting as
> infrastructure).
>
> Therefore, Yanu's total contribution would be calculated as 12.5% + 12.5% +
> 12.5% = 37.5%
