I propose a collaboration between programmers, business analysts, and designers
to create several free apps. These apps will be continuously maintained and
developed to attract a large user base.

We will place relevant ads on these apps. If a user wants to remove the ads,
they will need to subscribe monthly.

Profits generated will be divided based on the following percentages, according
to workload assumption.

| Role               | Description                                      | Output                                  |                Sharing Profit                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------: |
| Business Analyst   | Define user requirements & business flow         | Business Requirements Document (BRD)    |                     20 %                      |
| Designer           | Design UI/UX applications.                       | Clickable Figma Prototype               |                     20 %                      |
| Frontend Developer | Create a user interface & integrate it with APIs | Web Application (SSR)                   |                     20 %                      |
| Backend Developer  | Build, test & deploy the applications            | Application Programming Interface (API) |                     20 %                      |
| Core Framework     | Framework maintenance & app dev coordination     | Fastro Framework & Timeline             |                     10 %                      |
| Infrastructure     | Maintain the operational of Server & Database    | The Live Application                    |                      5%                       |
| Freelance Sales    | Attract vendors to run ads on the platform       | Ads placement                           | 5% commission from every income they bring in |

Those schemes can be changed to adapt to different situations and conditions.
