I propose a collaboration between programmers, business analysts, and designers
to create several free apps. These apps will be continuously maintained and
developed to attract a large user base.

We will place relevant ads on these apps. If a user wants to remove the ads,
they will need to subscribe monthly.

Every profit generated will be divided according to the following percentages.

| Role               | Description                                                   | Output                                                                                                   | Sharing Profit |

Those schemes can be changed to adapt to different situations and conditions.
