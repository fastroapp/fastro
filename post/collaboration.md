As the employer, you typically receive a fixed income based on a salary. That's
perfectly acceptable.

However, I now propose a collaboration between programmers, business analysts,
quality assurance, project manager, and designers to create several free apps.
These apps will be continuously maintained and developed to attract a large user
base.

We will place relevant ads on these apps. If a user wants to remove the ads,
they will need to subscribe on a monthly basis.

Profits generated will be divided based on the following percentages, according
to assumed workload.

| Role              | Task                                                               | Output                                  | Sharing Profit |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| Business Analyst  | Define user requirements & business flow                           | Business Requirements Document (BRD)    |      14 %      |
| Designer          | Design UI/UX applications.                                         | Clickable Figma Prototype               |      14 %      |
| Frontend          | Create a user interface & integrate it with APIs                   | Web Application (SSR)                   |      14 %      |
| Backend           | Database desain & create APIs                                      | Application Programming Interface (API) |      14 %      |
| Quality Assurance | Test and ensure the application's quality                          | Stakeholder satisfaction                |      14 %      |
| Product Manager   | Overseeing its entire lifecycle from ideation to launch and beyond | Epic, Sprint, User Stories & Timeline   |      14 %      |
| Infrastructure    | Maintain the operational of Server & Database                      | CI/CD, Deployment                       |      10 %      |
| Core Framework    | Framework maintenance                                              | Updated Framework                       |      6 %       |

## Comission from every new income

| Role  | Task                                                                       | Output                     | commission |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | :--------: |
| Sales | Attract vendors and brands to run ads on the platform. Acquire paid users. | Ads placement & paid users |     5%     |

## Use case

It is posibble for a contributor to handle multiple task. And each task will be
calculated as sharing profit ratio.

For example:

> Imam's initial contribution was to design the purchase application (as a
> designer).
>
> However, to ensure a user-friendly experience, he then needed to gather
> feedback from actual users on how the application functioned (acting as a
> business analyst).
>
> Once the application was developed by the development team (including
> developers, QA testers, DevOps engineers, and a product manager), Imam
> successfully attracted brands to place advertisements on the platform.
>
> Therefore, Imam's total contribution would be calculated as 14% + 14% = 28%
>
> He also gets a 5% commission on the deals he secures with brands.
