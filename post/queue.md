This article explores how using queues can prevent race conditions in concurrent
programming by ensuring orderly access to shared resources, enhancing data
integrity and application reliability.

```ts
import { assertEquals } from "@app/core/server/deps.ts";
import { createTaskQueue } from "@app/utils/queue.ts";

Deno.test("Queue: create message", async () => {
    const q = createTaskQueue();
    const x = await q.process(() => "x");
    const y = await q.process(() => 1);
    const z = await q.process(() => true);
    const o = await q.process(() => ({}));
    const v = await q.process(() => {});
    assertEquals(x, "x");
    assertEquals(y, 1);
    assertEquals(z, true);
    assertEquals(o, {});
    assertEquals(v, undefined);
});
```

We have already implemented queue mechanisms in our store to effectively manage
concurrent access to shared resources, allowing you to commit multiple data
entries in parallel.

```ts
Deno.test("Store: sync, same size after multiple commit", async () => {
    const newStore = new Store({
        owner: "fastrodev",
        repo: "fastro",
        path: "modules/store/map.json",
        branch: "store",
        token,
    });
    await Promise.all([
        newStore.set("user", "zaid").commit(),
        newStore.set("gender", "male").commit(),
        newStore.set("city", "pare").commit(),
        newStore.set("country", "indonesia").commit(),
    ]);
    assertEquals(newStore.size(), 4);
});
```

This approach has allowed us to:

- Enhance Performance: By organizing requests in a queue, we can process them
  sequentially, reducing the likelihood of conflicts and improving overall
  system performance.
- Maintain Data Integrity: With controlled access to shared resources, we
  minimize the risk of data corruption, ensuring that transactions are completed
  accurately.
- Improve User Experience: Customers experience smoother interactions as their
  requests are handled in an orderly fashion, leading to faster response times
  and increased satisfaction.
- Scalability: Our queue system allows us to scale operations efficiently,
  accommodating higher volumes of transactions without compromising performance.

By leveraging this strategy, we have successfully mitigated race conditions,
resulting in a more reliable and efficient store environment.
